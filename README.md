# Problems I Faced ðŸ«¤
1. Problem1: Difficulty in aligning elements as per the design.
   
   *Solution:*
     - Ensured you understand the use of Flexbox and CSS Grid. These tools are powerful for creating complex layouts.
     - Used browser developer tools to inspect elements and understand how margins, paddings, and other properties affect the layout.

   
3. Problem2: Maintaining a consistent style across the page.
   
   *Solution:*
     - Defined a global style guide with your color scheme, font sizes, and other common styles.
     - Used CSS variables (custom properties) to maintain consistency and make updates easier.


4. Problem3: Images are not displaying correctly or are too large/small.

   *Solution:*
     - Ensured images are properly referenced with the correct file paths.
     - Used appropriate image formats and sizes for web use. Optimize images to reduce load times.
     - Used CSS properties like object-fit to control how images are displayed within their containers.
